-- | Scan central directory of an archive and return its description
-- 'ArchiveDescription' as well as collection of its entries.
--
-- This operation may fail with:
--
--     * @isAlreadyInUseError@ if the file is already open and cannot be
--     reopened;
--
--     * @isDoesNotExistError@ if the file does not exist;
--
--     * @isPermissionError@ if the user does not have permission to open
--     the file;
--
--     * 'ParsingFailed' when specified archive is something this library
--     cannot parse (this includes multi-disk archives, for example).
--
-- Please note that entries with invalid (non-portable) file names may be
-- missing in list of entries. Files that are compressed with unsupported
-- compression methods are skipped as well. Also, if several entries would
-- collide on some operating systems (such as Windows, because of its
-- case-insensitivity), only one of them will be available, because
-- 'EntrySelector' is case-insensitive. These are consequences of the design
-- decision to make it impossible to create non-portable archives with this
-- library.
